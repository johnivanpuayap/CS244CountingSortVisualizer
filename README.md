A simple implementation of Counting Sort in C++ for a presentation in our CS244 Design and Analysis of Algorithm course. It allows the user to generateCancel changes a random array of integers and sort it using the Counting Sort algorithm, while displaying the intermediate steps of the algorithm in the command line.
