# Counting Sort Implementation Demo

A simple implementation of Counting Sort in C++ for a presentation in our CS244 Design and Analysis of Algorithm course. It allows the user to generate a random array of integers and sort it ascending or descending using the Counting Sort algorithm, while displaying the phases and important steps of the algorithm in the command line.
