# Counting Sort Implementation Demo

A simple implementation of Counting Sort in C++ for a presentation in our CS244 Design and Analysis of Algorithm course. It allows the user to generate a random array of integers and sort it in ascending or descending order using the Counting Sort algorithm, while displaying the phases and important steps of the algorithm in the command line.
