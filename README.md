# Counting Sort Visualizer

A simple Counting Sort algorithm implemented in C++ for a presentation in our CS244 Design and Analysis of Algorithm Course. The program allows the user to generate a random array of integers and sort it using the Counting Sort algorithm, while displaying the intermediate steps of the algorithm in a the command line.
